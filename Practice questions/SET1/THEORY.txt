7. Arrays are homogenous and structures are heterogeneous
Arrays cannot be passsed through functions but structures can.
Syntax
    datatype identifier[size_of_array]
    struct STRUCTURE_NAME { datatype members };
    struct STRUCTURE_NAME structure_variable;
Structures allows us to create a custom datatype, but arrays rely on the fundamental datatypes.
